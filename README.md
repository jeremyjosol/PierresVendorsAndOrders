# Pierre's Vendors and Orders

## About

Pierre, the artisan baker, inquired about a new project for a web application tailored to revitalize his bakery's vendor and order management following the success of our first console application we designed for him. This new application welcomes him with a minimalistic yet stylish splash page, offering a user-friendly interface crafted with the MVC (Model, View, Controller) model and Razor syntax. Pierre can easily create new vendor lists, add orders to the relevant vendor, delete all vendors/orders, and or choose to delete vendors/orders individually to help keep track of Pierre's Bakery business.
